- Only tested on Windows 10/11

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jack-vexel-ws/zcamhttp
   cd zcamhttp
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser,for Windows platform, you can usually double-click this file to automatically open the default browser of the machine. 
3. Enter your camera's IP address in the IP input field
4. Start searching and executing commands!

## üìñ How to Use

### Enter Camera IP Address
- Locate the IP input field at the top of the interface
- Enter your ZCAM camera's IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
- All command URLs will automatically update with the new input IP

### Searching Commands

## IMPORTANT TIPS
When you get a command which has `$XXXX`, for example, `$key`, `$value`, it means this command have option parameters, you should fill correct parameters, a string or value in there, then exeucte your command.

### How to get the parameters type and range
> For most commands, if it is a set command like this `/ctrl/set?$key=$value`, then you can use its get command `/ctrl/get?k=$key` to get its type and range
(Please reference [ZCAM offical Http API document](https://github.com/imaginevision/Z-Camera-Doc/blob/master/E2/protocol/http/http.md#Camera-settings) to learn the data type and range)

### Examples 
`image brightness` command, execute `/ctrl/get?k=brightness` command to get its type and range, like this:

```
{
  "code": 0,
  "desc": "string",
  "key": "brightness",
  "type": 2,
  "ro": 0,
  "value": 50,
  "min": 0,
  "max": 100,
  "step": 1
}
```
its type is 2, it means it is a value type, have min and max range, you can send `/ctrl/set?brightness=50` to set image brightness to 50

`image profile` command, send `/ctrl/get?k=lut` to get its response like this:

```
{
  "code": 0,
  "desc": "string",
  "key": "lut",
  "type": 1,
  "ro": 0,
  "value": "Rec.709",
  "opts": [
    "Rec.709",
    "Z-Log2",
    "Flat",
    "HLG",
    "Vivid 0",
    "Vivid 1",
    "Vivid 2",
    "Concert",
    "Gamma"
  ],
  "all": [
    "Rec.709",
    "Z-Log2",
    "Flat",
    "Concert",
    "Vivid 0",
    "Vivid 1",
    "Vivid 2",
    "HLG",
    "Gamma"
  ]
}
```
Its type is 1, it has option values `Rec.709` `Z-log2` `HLG`...Ôºå you can send `/ctrl/set?lut=HLG` to set image profile to `HLG`.

## üåê Language Support

- The WEB interface automatically detects your browser language. Currently, only Chinese and English are supported. Unsupported languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill automatically run in English.
- You can search using keywords in both `ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá` and `English`.
